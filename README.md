# TrainScheduler
Train scheduler incorporates Firebase to store arival/departure data using Moment.js.

The steps to complete are:
   1. Initialize Firebase
   2. Create button for adding trains - then update the html + update the database
   3. When adding a train, submit the following:
      3a. Train Name
      3b. Destination 
      3c. First Train Time -- in military time
      3d. Frequency -- in minutes
      3e. Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
      3f. Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
   4. Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
